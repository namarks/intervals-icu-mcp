# Intervals.icu MCP Server

![Intervals.icu MCP Server](docs/heading.png)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Intervals.icu integration. Access your training data, wellness metrics, and performance analysis through Claude and other LLMs.

[![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Overview

This MCP server provides 48 tools to interact with your Intervals.icu account, organized into 9 categories:

- Activities (10 tools) - Query, search, update, delete, and download activities
- Activity Analysis (8 tools) - Deep dive into streams, intervals, best efforts, and histograms
- Athlete (2 tools) - Access profile, fitness metrics, and training load
- Wellness (3 tools) - Track and update recovery, HRV, sleep, and health metrics
- Events/Calendar (9 tools) - Manage planned workouts, races, notes with bulk operations
- Performance/Curves (3 tools) - Analyze power, heart rate, and pace curves
- Workout Library (2 tools) - Browse and explore workout templates and plans
- Gear Management (6 tools) - Track equipment and maintenance reminders
- Sport Settings (5 tools) - Configure FTP, FTHR, pace thresholds, and zones

Additionally, the server provides:

- 1 MCP Resource - Athlete profile with fitness metrics for ongoing context
- 6 MCP Prompts - Templates for common queries (training analysis, performance analysis, activity deep dive, recovery check, training plan review, weekly planning)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), OR
- Docker

## Intervals.icu API Key Setup

Before installation, you need to obtain your Intervals.icu API key:

1. Go to https://intervals.icu/settings
2. Scroll to the **Developer** section
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy the API key (you'll use it during setup)
5. Note your **Athlete ID** from your profile URL (format: `i123456`)

## Installation & Setup

### How Authentication Works

1. API Key - Simple API key authentication (no OAuth required)
2. Configuration - API key and athlete ID saved to `.env` file
3. Basic Auth - HTTP Basic Auth with username "API_KEY" and your key as password
4. Persistence - Subsequent runs reuse stored credentials

### Option 1: Using UV

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd intervals-icu-mcp
uv sync
```

Then configure credentials using one of these methods:

#### Interactive Setup

```bash
uv run intervals-icu-mcp-auth
```

This will prompt for your API key and athlete ID and save credentials to `.env`.

#### Manual Setup

Create a `.env` file manually:

```bash
INTERVALS_ICU_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
INTERVALS_ICU_ATHLETE_ID=i123456
```

### Option 2: Using Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t intervals-icu-mcp .
```

Then configure credentials using one of these methods:

#### Interactive Setup

```bash
# Create the env file first (Docker will create it as a directory if it doesn't exist)
touch intervals-icu-mcp.env

# Run the setup script
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/intervals-icu-mcp.env:/app/.env" \
  --entrypoint= \
  intervals-icu-mcp:latest \
  python -m intervals_icu_mcp.scripts.setup_auth
```

This will prompt for credentials and save them to `intervals-icu-mcp.env`.

#### Manual Setup

Create an `intervals-icu-mcp.env` file manually in your current directory (see UV manual setup above for format).

## Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your configuration file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Using UV

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "intervals-icu": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/intervals-icu-mcp",
        "intervals-icu-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "intervals-icu": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/intervals-icu-mcp.env:/app/.env",
        "intervals-icu-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Ask Claude to interact with your Intervals.icu data using natural language. The server provides tools, a resource, and prompt templates to help you get started.

### Quick Start with MCP Prompts

Use built-in prompt templates for common queries (available via prompt suggestions in Claude):

- `analyze-recent-training` - Comprehensive training analysis over a specified period
- `performance-analysis` - Analyze power/HR/pace curves and zones
- `activity-deep-dive` - Deep dive into a specific activity with streams, intervals, and best efforts
- `recovery-check` - Recovery assessment with wellness trends and training load
- `training-plan-review` - Weekly training plan evaluation with workout library
- `plan-training-week` - AI-assisted weekly training plan creation based on current fitness

### Activities

```
"Show me my activities from the last 30 days"
"Get details for my last long run"
"Find all my threshold workouts"

```

### Activity Analysis

```
